<h1>Shower Mouse</h1>
<aside>A very unusual tale...</aside>
</header>
<p>Now, this is a story all about how<br />
My mouse got flipped-turned upside down<br />
And I'd like to take a minute<br />
Just site right there<br />
I tell you how I became the owner of mouse full of hair</p>
<p>In west Farnborough born and raised<br />
At the keyboard I spent most of my days.<br />
Chilling out, haxin', DnD'ing, all cool<br />
And playing FPS's each day after school<br />
When a couple of hairs they were up to no good<br />
Started making trouble when my mouse moved<br />
I got 360 no scoped and my mum got scared<br />
She said "You're washing that mouse to get rid of that hair"</p>
<p>I walked up to the sink and when I got near<br />
I said "This sink sucks, I'm going in there"<br />
If anything I could say this behaviour was rare<br />
But I thought "Nah forget it, I'm going in the show-air"<br />
I set the temp about 7 or 8<br />
And I smiled to the mouse "Don't worry, I will take care"<br />
I looked at my mouse<br />
And the was nothing wrong there<br />
I could go back to my desk with a mouse without hair.</p>
